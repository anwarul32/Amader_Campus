            <p> <h1>We Teach here <strong>Life Skills Based Education </strong> </h1>
                <strong>Life Skills Based Education</strong> is the foundation each tutoring contract is rooted in.

                Life Skills Based Education (LSBE) refers to an interactive process of teaching and learning which enables learners to acquire knowledge and to develop attitudes and skills which support the adoption of healthy behaviours.

                The World Health Organization defines life skills as “abilities for adaptive and positive behaviour that enable individuals to deal effectively with the demands and challenges of everyday life”. Psychosocial and interpersonal skills are as important as acquisition of knowledge  to be successful in life. In order to excel at a job, a sport or any discipline, a person must acquire and master these skills: it is necessary to be able to reference more than a body of information in our complex world.

                Around the world, LSBE is being adopted as a means to empower young people in challenging situations. LSBE refers to an interactive process of teaching and learning which enables learners to acquire knowledge and to develop attitudes and skills which support the adoption of healthy behaviours. It is a critical element in The Twist as it embodies the definition of quality education.

                The challenges children and young people regularly face are many, and require more than even the best numeracy and literacy skills. That is why 164 nations, under the United Nations Education sector (UNESCO), include “life skills” as a basic learning need for all young people.

                Around the world, LSBE is being adopted as a means to empower young people in challenging situations. This is why all of our tutoring contracts pair a life skill with an academic skill. We guarantee success beyond the classroom through the life skills that we introduce and reinforce, including:
